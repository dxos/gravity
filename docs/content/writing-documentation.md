# Documentation

## Process

Documentation is like code: it needs to be constantly maintained otherwise it quickly becomes technical debt.
People like DOING not READING: write simple informative documents that people can scan.

- Favor shorter documents focused on a very specific topic.
- Start documents with consise bullets that others can scan, correct, add to.
  For example, [this](http://download.aopa.org/121010av-adventures.pdf) is how to fly an airplane.
- Consider how and when the documentation could become out-of-date.
- Fix documentation that doesn't work (at the very least update the docs to note it is broken).

- TODO(burdon): Document Gatsby.
- TODO(burdon): Doc types: instructions (like this), design docs, specs, tutorials, etc.


## Style

- Assume that EVERYTHING will be public.
- Don't use first or second person pronouns (I, we, you, etc.)


## Formatting

- Use MD files.
- Use lowercase hyphenated file names (for files, folders, diagrams, etc.)
- MD files are more readable with line breaks after sentences or clauses.
- Don't prefix command line exampels with `$` or `>`; make it easy to copy-and-paste.

A normative section is a formal part of the recommendation. It contains rules that everyone must follow.
A non-normative, or informative, section contains additional information (e.g., advice) that isn't a formal part of the standard. 
That doesn't mean the information is less important, but it's not binding in the same way as the normative sections.
